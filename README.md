# Building a Snowflake Data Pipeline & LLM Analytics for GoogleÂ Reviews
### A Case Study for Poppy Kids Pediatric Dentistry

#### The Challenge:
**1. Vanishing Reviews:** Google's policy enforcement can lead to the sudden removal of reviews. While this helps maintain quality, it can inadvertently remove legitimate feedback. Without a system to track these changes, our business loses valuable insights and the ability to dispute removals effectively.

**2. Performance Insights:** Reviews serve as a real-time barometer of business performance. A comprehensive review dataset enables deep analytics, helping the practice continually improve its services. Also, Google utilizes machine learning models to evaluate reviews. While this policy is necessary, it underscores the importance of having our own record of reviews. What better way than doing my own analytics and assessing their approach?

#### The Solution: 
**A Snowflake Data Pipeline that runs weekly & Cortex Analytics**
